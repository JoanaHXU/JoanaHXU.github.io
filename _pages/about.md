I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at [Centre of Transformative Garment Production](https://www.transgp.hk/), The University of Hong Kong ([HKU](https://www.hku.hk/)), under the supervision of Prof. [Pan Jia](https://www.cs.hku.hk/people/academic-staff/jpan). 
Previously, I received my Ph.D. from [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/computing), Nanyang Techonology University ([NTU](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/)), Singapore, in 2023. 
My Ph.D. was supervised by Prof. [Zinovi Rabinovich](https://www.zinovi.net/), working on reinforcement learning and behaviour manipulation.![image](https://github.com/JoanaHXU/JoanaHXU.github.io/assets/50697646/c5756a3f-52a8-452b-8ddf-2889b86d46a8)
My research interests lie in the intersection of robotic manipulation and machine learning (reinforcement learning and imitation learning).



**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
